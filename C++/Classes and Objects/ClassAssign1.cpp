/*Create a gameStory() function and call it inside main() function.
Inside gameStory() function, create an awesome game story of your game using cout statements.
Create a Player class. Inside the Player class:
Create a public property called health
Create a public property called attack_power
Create a constructor for Player class which takes 2 integer parameters to assign health and attack_power properties
Create an object of Player inside main() function. (After gameStory() is called)*/
